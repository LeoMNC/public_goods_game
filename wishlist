Make tranfering and punishing work
Round 1 = Practice Round -> reset accumulated points for Round 2
Add round/stage language earlier on into description 
Add image explaining rules to player’s screen
Coins are not being properly converted to accumulated points / added at end of round
Accumulation from previous round confuses participants
Punish Stage: option to not punish 
Server should update as participants go through stages + rounds
Transfer stage: after clicking the arrow for the amount… it rerenders the whole page for steven 
Maximum of 5 for transfers?
Unclear if you have 0 coins // don't know if you have enough to monitor etc  (ambiguity around when you get return)
Round coins + points wherever displayed… shouldn't be 0000000
Let participants see their own history
During intermission show the remainder of coins of other players… if not their coins, then their ranking… public moves??
Add to instructions what is public information and what is not

Disclaimer about money
turn all points talk to money talk

receive monitoring feedback before punish
remove monitoring cost column from monitoring results
remove last contribution from round 1 (or set to current contribution)
Change # punishing + transfers in credits
Transfers: numbers change after every round/stage -> show step by step ->> scoreboard.jsx ??
Tokens at the top right -> should update after every stage
Add to protocol: let participants explain the rules of the game wrong… DON’T correct them unless they ask you for clarification
