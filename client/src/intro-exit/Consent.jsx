            <p>
              You are being asked to participate in a research study involving
              strategic interaction between people. <br></br>
              We hope to learn what strategies people use to make decisions
              in a social context, and how this results in group-level patterns.

            <p>
              If you choose to be in the study, you will be asked to answer
              questions, play a game, and/or describe your reasoning. You will
              respond by writing, speaking, typing, and/or clicking on a
              computer screen. We may record your responses, including all
              interactions with the computer. These tasks allow us to better
              understand how people interact with others in strategic
              environments. This should take between 10 minutes and two hours. The
              study will be completed either in-person at the University of
              California, Merced, or online on your computer. You can stop the
              study at any time. Approximately 1,000 people will participate in
              this study.

              Participants should generally not experience any risks beyond
              those of daily living and computer use. One potential risk is
              frustration when trying to solve more difficult reasoning
              problems. For participants who are videorecorded, breach of
              confidentiality is also a potential risk.
